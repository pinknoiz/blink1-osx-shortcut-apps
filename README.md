# Blink(1) OSX shortcut apps
### Shortcut apps to change the color of your [Blink(1)](http://blink1.thingm.com/) USB light.

I use the great Blink(1) USB multi-color LED light to subtly to my colleagues when I'm available or not while working (so, if they can interrupt me or not).
But I was tired to launch the official control panel to change the light according to my status, so I used AppleScript to code a few simple apps to quickly switch between colors.

Here are the color "codes" for me:
- Green = available
- Red = do not disturb
- Orange = in a meeting
- Blue = Having a coffee
